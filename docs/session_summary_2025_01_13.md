## Next Steps
1. Consider implementing alert acknowledgment functionality
2. Add support for alert notes and comments
3. Implement alert resolution tracking
4. Add alert history and audit trail features
5. Consider adding alert templates for common scenarios

## Issues Resolved
- Fixed alert visibility in API responses
- Resolved integration status issues
- Improved alert formatting and readability
- Enhanced error handling and logging

## Best Practices Implemented
1. Proper error handling
2. Comprehensive logging
3. Type-safe interfaces
4. Clear documentation
5. Consistent response formatting

## üîß Technical Implementations

### 1. OpsGenie Integration
- **File Modified**: `lib/tools/opsgenie.ts`
- **Key Features Added**:
  - Get on-call participants across all schedules
  - Create alerts with priority levels (P1-P5)
  - View existing alerts
  - List and manage schedules
- **API Functions**:
  ```typescript
  - getAlerts(args: GetAlertsArgs)
  - createAlert(args: CreateAlertArgs)
  - getSchedules(args: GetSchedulesArgs)
  - getOnCallParticipants(args: GetOnCallParticipantsArgs)
  ```

### 2. Confluence Integration
- **File Modified**: `lib/tools/confluence.ts`
- **Key Features Added**:
  - Search spaces and pages
  - Create new pages
  - Get space information
- **API Functions**:
  ```typescript
  - getSpaces(args: GetSpacesArgs)
  - getPages(args: GetPagesArgs)
  - searchContent(args: SearchContentArgs)
  - createPage(args: CreatePageArgs)
  ```

### 3. Tools Integration
- **File Modified**: `lib/tools/index.ts`
- **Changes Made**:
  - Updated tool definitions for both OpsGenie and Confluence
  - Improved response formatting
  - Added proper type definitions
  - Implemented error handling

## üéØ Feature Highlights

### OpsGenie Capabilities
1. **On-Call Management**
   - Check current on-call engineers
   - View schedule details
   - See team assignments

2. **Alert Management**
   - Create alerts with different priority levels
   - Add descriptions and tags
   - View alert status and details

### Confluence Capabilities
1. **Content Management**
   - Search across spaces and pages
   - Create new pages with formatted content
   - View space information

2. **Space Management**
   - List available spaces
   - Get space details
   - Navigate space hierarchy

## üîç Testing Instructions
Users can now interact with both services using natural language queries such as:

### OpsGenie Examples:
- "Who is on call right now?"
- "Create a P1 alert for service outage"
- "Show me all open alerts"
- "What schedules do we have?"

### Confluence Examples:
- "Show me all spaces"
- "Search for pages about deployment"
- "Create a new page in space KEY with title 'Test Page'"

## üöÄ Next Steps
1. Consider implementing environment variables for API keys
2. Add more sophisticated error handling
3. Implement rate limiting for API calls
4. Add support for updating existing Confluence pages
5. Enhance response formatting for better readability

## üîê Security Notes
- API keys are currently stored in the code (should be moved to environment variables)
- Authentication is properly handled through the application's auth system
- API requests are made server-side to protect credentials

## üìù Technical Debt
1. Move API keys to environment variables
2. Implement proper API error handling
3. Add request rate limiting
4. Add proper logging for API calls
5. Implement retry mechanisms for failed API calls

Here are all the questions you can ask your chatbot based on the implemented functions:

Confluence Questions:
List Spaces:
"Show me all Confluence spaces"
"List available Confluence spaces"
"What spaces do I have in Confluence?"
List Pages:

"Create a documentation page about [topic] in Confluence"
"Add a new page to SD space about [topic]"
Update Pages:
"Update the page [page-id] with new content"
"Add a section to Confluence page [page-id]"
"Update the content of [page-title] in SD space"
Search Content:
"Find Confluence pages containing 'deployment'"
"Search for pages about 'testing' in SD space"
"Look for Confluence content about [topic]"
OpsGenie Questions:
